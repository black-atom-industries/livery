                    Livery applies your chosen theme across all configured developer tools
                    simultaneously. Pick once, update everywhere.
                </Typo.Lead>
                <Typo.P>
                    Each theme defines a set of semantic color tokens that map to specific UI roles
                    — foreground, background, accents, and status colors. These tokens are resolved
                    at runtime and written to each tool's configuration file through dedicated
                    updaters.
                </Typo.P>
                <Typo.P>
                    The updater pipeline reads the current theme definition from{" "}
                    <Typo.InlineCode>@black-atom/core</Typo.InlineCode>, transforms it into
                    tool-specific formats, and writes the results to disk. Neovim receives a Lua
                    colorscheme, Alacritty gets a TOML snippet, and Delta picks up a gitconfig block
                    — all from the same source of truth.

                    To add support for a new developer tool, you need to implement an updater in the

                <Typo.H3>The problem with dotfiles</Typo.H3>
                <Typo.P>
                    Every developer has a dotfiles repo. Mine had 23 files across 8 tools, each with
                    its own color format — hex triplets in Alacritty, Lua tables in Neovim, ANSI
                    indices in Tmux. Changing a theme meant editing half a dozen files by hand and
                    hoping nothing broke.
                </Typo.P>
                <Typo.P>
                    The first version of Livery was a shell script. It read a JSON palette and ran
                    {" "}
                    <Typo.InlineCode>sed</Typo.InlineCode>{" "}
                    replacements across config files. It worked until it didn't — one malformed
                    regex and my <Typo.InlineCode>.tmux.conf</Typo.InlineCode>{" "}
                    was gone. That was the moment I decided to build something real.
                </Typo.P>

                <Typo.Blockquote>
                    The goal was never to build a theme editor. It was to make theme switching a
                    single action, no matter how many tools you use.
                </Typo.Blockquote>

                <Typo.H3>Semantic tokens as the common language</Typo.H3>
                <Typo.P>
                    Instead of mapping raw hex colors to each tool, Livery works with semantic
                    tokens. A token like <Typo.InlineCode>fg-accent</Typo.InlineCode> means{" "}
                    <Typo.Highlight>the primary accent foreground color</Typo.Highlight>, regardless
                    of whether it ends up as{" "}
                    <Typo.InlineCode>vim.api.nvim_set_hl()</Typo.InlineCode>{" "}
                    in Neovim or a TOML value in Alacritty. The theme defines the token values, and
                    each updater knows how to translate them.
                </Typo.P>
                <Typo.P>
                    This separation is what makes the system extensible. Adding a new tool means
                    writing one updater — you never touch the theme definitions.
                </Typo.P>

                <Typo.H3>The Rust boundary</Typo.H3>
                <Typo.P>
                    Early on we made a decision that shaped everything:{" "}
                    <Typo.Highlight>
                        TypeScript orchestrates, Rust executes
                    </Typo.Highlight>
                    . The frontend decides which theme to apply and which tools to update. The
                    backend handles every filesystem write, socket connection, and platform-specific
                    operation.

                    This isn't just architecture for architecture's sake. Tauri's scoped filesystem
                    API means the app can only write to paths the user has explicitly allowed. If a
                    bug in the UI layer tries to write somewhere unexpected, the backend refuses.
                    It's a safety net that shell scripts can never provide.

                <Typo.H3>What we learned</Typo.H3>

                    <li>
                        Config formats are messier than you think. TOML, YAML, Lua, and gitconfig
                        all have different quoting rules, comment syntax, and merge semantics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Live reload is the killer feature. Neovim's socket API lets us push
                        colorscheme changes without restarting — once you have that, going back to
                        manual restarts feels broken
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Platform paths are a minefield. macOS uses{" "}
                        <Typo.InlineCode>~/Library/Application Support</Typo.InlineCode>, Linux uses
                        {" "}
                        <Typo.InlineCode>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</Typo.InlineCode>, and some tools ignore
                        both conventions entirely
                    </li>

                <Typo.H3>What comes next</Typo.H3>
                <Typo.P>
                    We're working on theme previews — a way to see how a palette looks across your
                    tools before committing to it. The challenge is rendering accurate previews for
                    terminal emulators and editors without actually launching them. We're exploring
                    a token-based preview system that renders synthetic UI from the semantic
                    palette.

                    If you're interested in contributing or just want to follow along, the project
                    is open source on GitHub. We'd especially love help with updaters for tools we
                    don't use ourselves — Kitty, WezTerm, Zellij, and others.
