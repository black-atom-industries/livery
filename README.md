> Paint your cockpit.

A CLI for managing [Black Atom](https://github.com/black-atom-industries) themes across your developer tools. Pick a theme once, apply it everywhere.

Part of the Black Atom cockpit — [radar](https://github.com/black-atom-industries/radar.nvim) (file nav) + [helm](https://github.com/black-atom-industries/helm) (workspace nav) + **livery** (theme management).

**Name origin**: In aviation, *livery* is the paint scheme of an aircraft — its visual identity.

## Status

Early development. See the [livery project](https://linear.app/black-atom-industries/project/livery-ebebb9cdaef9) for progress.
